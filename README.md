Problem 7: Decision Tree on Iris Dataset
Task
  ->rain DecisionTreeClassifier with different depths (max_depth = 1, 2, 3).
  ->Report training and test accuracy.
  ->Discuss signs of underfitting vs. overfitting.
Key Points
  ->Depth=1: High bias → underfits (low accuracy).
  ->Depth=3: Captures more complexity → risk of overfitting.
  ->Depth=2: Balanced trade-off.
